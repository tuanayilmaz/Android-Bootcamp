This project is a number-guessing game in Kotlin. 
The user enters a number between 0 and 100. If the guess is higher than the actual number the system prints "Try a smaller number". If the guess is smaller than the actual number then the system prints "Try a bigger number.".
The user has 3 guesses. They should know the answer before their guesses are completed. If the user does not enter the correct answer then the user does not win and the program is terminated.
